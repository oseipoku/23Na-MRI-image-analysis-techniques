To ensure accurate quantitative 23Na-MRI, RF field (B1)  inhomogeneity  which has influence on the sodium signal intensity should be computed and corrected. 

These codes map the B1 field distribution of the RF field at the sodium frequency using the double angle method (DAM) where two sodium images (I1 and I2) are acquired with flip angles I1 = α = 45°  and I2 = 2α = 90° from a large phantom that fills the whole RF coil volume and contains a known standard sodium concentration.

These codes were developed by Dr. Linda Osei Poku during a Ph.D studies at the Molecular Imaging Research Center (MIRC), Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.
These codes should not be reproduced, distributed, or have any derivative created without the concent of the Author.
Also the author of these codes should be appriopriatly referenced and ackwledged upon their usage
